# ToDoList

## Vanilla javascript project made while following The Odin Project curriculum.

This projects finds its main goal in helping me learn to follow oop principles in js.
The application is essentially a To-do list which allows the user to create, modify and 
update a list of todos and stores this information in the local storage.
